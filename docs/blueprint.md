## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Shades of Blue (#003399, #6699CC, #ADD8E6) to evoke trust and professionalism in the 'About Us' and initial sections.
- Accent color: Yellow (#FFC300) gradually introduced to highlight calls-to-action and signify the transition towards solutions and marketing on subsequent pages.
- Support colors: Grey (#808080) and Black (#000000) for text, backgrounds, and shadows to ensure readability and contrast.
- Font: 'Book Antiqua' (serif) with all small caps used site-wide to maintain a consistent and stylized look. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use a shard-based visual motif throughout the website, varying the prominence of blue and yellow shards to reflect the theme progression across pages. Do not overwhelm the layout.
- Implement subtle transitions as users scroll down pages, further emphasizing the progression of shard and color schemes.
